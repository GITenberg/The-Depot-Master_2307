description: '"The conductor waved his hand, the engine puffed, the bell rang, and
  the train moved onward. For another twelve hours East Harniss was left marooned
  by the outside world." Delightful old novel about Captain Solomon Berry, who is
  the Depot Master in East Harniss. With unsurpassed opportunities for observing the
  people and events of the village, he himself becomes involved in his own love affair.'
